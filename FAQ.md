**Do you need help making the game?**
Currently I am not seeking additional help with the game. In the future I will likely seek additonal help for things like music.

No, but they will be in control of a terrestrial army that they will use to fight off the native species on the planet.

**What game engine is Phos made with?**
Unity

**When will Phos be released?**
TBD, likely by the end of this year I will have betas.

**How much will Phos cost?**
I'm not sure not a price point yet, but it definitely won't exceed $20 with the current scope of development plans.



**Can I join the testing team?**
Not currently, once I have things that require more people to test I will start accepting new people into the testing team. Until then I will be seeking feedback for design decisions for the game in the #polls channel.

**What is the meaning behind the name "Phos"**
Phos is short for Phosphophyllite an end game resource in the game and also slightly inspired by the character Phos in the anime Land of the Lustrous.

**Will there be co-op or multiplayer?**
Currently there are no plans for it. But if co-op or multiplayer seems like it will be a good fit later on then I might look into implementing it.

**Will you do tutorials on _____**
I would like to do some tutorials, but it is unlikely that I will have the time to create a video tutorial. I may do some written tutorials.
