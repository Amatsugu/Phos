# Phos

## This project is being rewritten in a differnt engine
Follow the new version here: https://github.com/Amatsugu/phos-neo

You play as a robot colonizer that has been sent out to an alien planet with one goal. Harvest its resources and send them back home. To accomplish this you must build a base on the planet. As your base develops you will be able to build more advanced structures to harvest at an increased scale. And eventually you will be able to accomplish your goal of sending resources back to your mother planet. But your invasion wont go unchallenged. The native inhabitants of the planet wonâ€™t sit idly by as you strip their world of its resources.
